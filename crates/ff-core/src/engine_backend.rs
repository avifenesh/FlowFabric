//! The `EngineBackend` trait — abstracting FlowFabric's write surface.
//!
//! **RFC-012 Stage 1a:** this is the trait landing. The
//! Valkey-backed impl lives in `ff-backend-valkey`; future backends
//! (Postgres) add a sibling crate with their own impl. ff-sdk's
//! `FlowFabricWorker` gains `connect_with(backend)` /
//! `backend(&self)` accessors so consumers that want to bring their
//! own backend (tests, future non-Valkey deployments) can hand one
//! in. The hot-path migration of `ClaimedTask` / `FlowFabricWorker`
//! to forward through the trait lands across Stages 1b-1d.
//!
//! # Object safety
//!
//! `EngineBackend` is object-safe: all methods are `async fn` behind
//! `#[async_trait]` and take `&self`. Consumers can hold
//! `Arc<dyn EngineBackend>` for heterogenous-backend deployments.
//! The trait is `Send + Sync + 'static` per RFC-012 §4.1; every impl
//! must honour that bound.
//!
//! # Error surface
//!
//! Every method returns [`Result<_, EngineError>`]. `EngineError`'s
//! `Transport` variant carries a boxed `dyn Error + Send + Sync`;
//! Valkey-backed transport faults box a
//! `ff_script::error::ScriptError` (downcast via
//! `ff_script::engine_error_ext::transport_script_ref`). Other
//! backends box their native error type and set the `backend` tag
//! accordingly.
//!
//! # Atomicity contract
//!
//! Per-op state transitions MUST be atomic (RFC-012 §3.4). On Valkey
//! this is the single-FCALL-per-op property; on Postgres it is the
//! per-transaction property. A backend that cannot honour atomicity
//! for a given op either MUST NOT implement `EngineBackend` or MUST
//! return `EngineError::Unavailable { op }` for the affected method.
//!
//! # Replay semantics
//!
//! `complete`, `fail`, `cancel`, `suspend`, `delay`, `wait_children`
//! are idempotent under replay — calling twice with the same handle
//! and args returns the same outcome (success on first call, typed
//! `State` / `Contention` on subsequent calls where the fence triple
//! no longer matches a live lease).
